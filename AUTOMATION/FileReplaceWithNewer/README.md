# File copying

### Description

I built this program so I can back up my files with only new files or files that have changed since 
the last backup. This program recursively walks down every directory tree until it finds a file, then adds or replaces
this file into the backup directory. 

### Functionality
- Directory walking
- Selective file copying

### Instructions
It uses only the standard library so can be run as is.
